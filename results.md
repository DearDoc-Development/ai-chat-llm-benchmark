# Analysis of LLM Benchmarks for Chatbot Platform

## Introduction

In this analysis, we evaluate the performance of five different Large Language Models (LLMs) for a chatbot platform. Each model was tested using the same real conversation consisting of 12 steps, repeated 10 times per model. The focus was on two tasks:

- **Conversation Management**: Assessing the model's ability to maintain a coherent and relevant dialogue.
- **Data Management**: Evaluating how well the model extracts data from the conversation.

The following models were tested:

1. **GPT-4-Turbo**
2. **GPT-4o**
3. **Gemini 1.5 Pro**
4. **Gemini 1.5 Flash**
5. **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**

Performance metrics included:

- **Response Relevance and Accuracy**
- **Contextual Consistency**
- **Appropriateness of Suggestions**
- **Natural Language Quality**
- **Hallucination Detection**
- **Execution Time**
- **Errors and Hallucinations Count**
- **Suggestion Chips Count**
- **Token Usage and Cost**

This report presents a detailed analysis, including comparisons and visual representations of the results.
