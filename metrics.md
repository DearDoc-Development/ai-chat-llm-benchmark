# Evaluation Metrics

In assessing the performance of the various Large Language Models (LLMs) for the chatbot platform, several key metrics were utilized. These metrics provide a structured way to evaluate different aspects of the models' responses and behaviors during the conversation and data management tasks.

- **3: Adequate** - Somewhat relevant but with noticeable gaps.
- **2: Poor** - Partially relevant but with major inaccuracies.
- **1: Very Poor** - Mostly irrelevant or inaccurate.
